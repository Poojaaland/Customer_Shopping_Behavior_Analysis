Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow.
It includes loading and cleaning the dataset in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), running business-focused SQL queries in PostgreSQL, and building a final dashboard to visualize key insights.

The goal is to understand customer spending patterns, product performance, discount usage, and customer segmentation.

📂 Dataset

🧹 Project Steps
1. Load Dataset in Python

Imported dataset using pandas

Inspected structure, null values, duplicates, and data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics and distributions

Relationships between features

Identified trends, high-value customers, top products, and category behavior

3. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Corrected inconsistent categories

Converted columns into appropriate data types

Exported cleaned dataset for SQL analysis

(Jupyter Notebook used: Customer_shopping_behavior(data cleaning)-checkpoint.ipynb)

🗄 SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

File used: Customer_shopping_behavior(Data Analysis).sql

Key questions answered:

Total revenue generated by male vs female customers

Customers who used discounts but still spent above average

Top 5 products by average review rating

Comparison between Standard vs Express shipping spending

Revenue and average spend by subscribed vs non-subscribed customers

Products with highest discount usage percentage

Customer segmentation: New, Returning, Loyal

Top 3 most purchased products in each category

Relationship between repeat buyers and subscription

Age group-wise revenue contribution

📊 Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of:

Total revenue, orders, average spend

Insights by gender, age group, and subscription status

Top-performing products

Discount impact

Customer segmentation

Category-wise comparison

✔️ Results / Key Insights

(You can update these once you finalize the analysis)

Female customers contribute higher revenue compared to males

Subscribed customers have higher average purchase value

Electronics/Fashion categories show the highest order frequency

Discounts significantly increase purchase quantity but reduce per-unit spend

Loyal customers contribute major revenue share

Certain age groups show clear preference for high-value items
