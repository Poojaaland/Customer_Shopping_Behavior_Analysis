Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project

📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow.
It includes loading and cleaning the dataset in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), running business-focused SQL queries in PostgreSQL, and building a final dashboard to visualize key insights.

The goal is to understand customer spending patterns, product performance, discount usage, and customer segmentation.
